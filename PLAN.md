## Phase 3 — Core Feature Gaps (continued)

### ✅ Task 3.8: Procedural Build Assistant (`src/core/build_assistant.py`)
- Added BuildAssistant class with type-safe pydantic API
- MVP bridge logic: auto-generates rod bridge structure between anchors
- Unit tests in `core/tests/test_build_assistant.py`: check step count, part IDs, positions

### o. Task 3.9: Motor Spin Regression Fixes (`proc_0001`)
- Fixed physics joint creation crashes that prevented simulation transforms from streaming.
- Added backward-compatible joint inference for legacy snapshots/datasets that omit `joint_type`.
- Updated dataset conversion and simulation state handling so motorized models animate reliably in the viewer.
- Hardened revolute joint construction to use shared world-space pivots and rotational-hole axis selection, fixing over-constrained hinges that suppressed visible rod spin.
- Restricted motor torque driving to axle/revolute connections only, preventing non-axle mount snaps from absorbing motor force.
- Added sidecar-connect bootstrap in simulation startup so PLAY reliably launches backend simulation in Tauri/web modes.
